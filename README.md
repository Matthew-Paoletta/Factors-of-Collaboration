# COGS 108 Final Project – Group XXX

This repository contains the final group project for **COGS 108: Data Science in Practice**.

The project explores a data-driven research question using data science methodologies, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling. All work follows the structure and requirements outlined by the course.

## Project Structure

Template Jupyter notebooks are provided for each stage of the project. The required notebooks for this repository are:

- `ProjectProposal_groupXXX.ipynb`
- `DataCheckpoint_groupXXX.ipynb`

## Repository Guidelines

- This repository is **private** and is only visible to course instructors and group members.
- Only work on the notebook corresponding to the current project stage prior to its due date.
- After a submission deadline, development should continue in the next notebook.

- Edit this README
- Add scripts or helper files
- Include datasets or visualizations
- Organize the repository as desired
